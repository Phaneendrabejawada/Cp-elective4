# fixMostlyMagicSquare(L) [15 pts]
# In this week's writing session, we wrote isMostlyMagicSquare(L). Here, say we have a mostly magic square L, but 
# then we modify L by changing exactly one value in L so that it no longer is a mostly magic square. For this 
# exercise, we assume we have just such a list L, and your task is to find and fix that change. So, given the list 
# L, return a new list M such that M is the same as L, only with exactly one value changed, and M is a mostly magic 
# square.

	# Your code goes here
	rsl=[]
	csl=[]

		rsl.append(sum(L[i]))

		for j in range(len(L)):
			cs+=L[j][i]
		csl.append(cs)
		cs=0

	c=probcol(csl)
	v=valchange(csl)
	L[r][c]-=v

	return L
